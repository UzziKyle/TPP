# Welcome

## Introduction

This program solves transportation problems using linear programming techniques, specifically either the Stepping Stone or the Modified Distribution (MODI) method. By default, the initial algorithm used in this application is MODI.

## Usage

To execute the program, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python -m app
```

This command will start the application and prompt you for input to define the transportation problem to be solved.

## Running Tests in VSCode

1. **Open the Test Explorer**: Open the Test Explorer in VSCode by selecting `View` > `Test` from the top menu.

2. **Discover Tests**: The Test Explorer will automatically discover any test files in your workspace. If you don't see your test file listed, make sure it's saved in your workspace.

3. **Run Tests**: To run your tests, simply click on the "Run All Tests" button in the Test Explorer. Alternatively, you can run individual tests by clicking on the test name.

4. **View Test Results**: After running the tests, the Test Explorer will display the results in the sidebar. You'll see a summary of the test run, including the number of passed, failed, and skipped tests.

5. **Inspect Failures**: If any tests fail, you can click on the test name to view details about the failure. This will help you identify and fix any issues in your code.
